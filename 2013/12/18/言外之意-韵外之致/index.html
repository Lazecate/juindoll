    <section class="post-content">
      <p>这几天用午休又把《Before sunrise》《Before sunset》《Before<br>Midnight》三部曲过了一遍，没有大牌、没有眩目的特效，与其说是电影，它们更像主创人员每十年来一次思想汇报的真人秀。处在20岁，30岁，40岁的人生阶段，话唠主创表达着他们对于生死、爱情、亲情、家庭甚至包括政治、全球化等的见解。四五年后再看一遍，竟好像之前没看过一样，每每为某一段台词心有戚戚，很想拍手叫绝，我想上次看的时候，有些心境还没有达到，故看到听到也并没留下什么印象。</p>
<p>十年之后再看一遍，我也许又是另一番感慨，这也许也是此类电影的一个优势，它面对的是人在不同阶段必然会面对的问题，历久弥新；而以眩丽画面、特效取胜的，一时赚人眼球，如果没有内涵，那么技术总会进步，就像现在看七八十年代的电影一样，大部分会让人觉得荒谬、古怪甚至愚蠢。</p>
<p>这次再看一遍，更多是能体会到台词言外未说明道尽的部分，这需要观者根据自己的经历，对它进行再加工，碰巧跟主创当时的情境相合，于是才会产生一种不必言说，各自心中自明的绝妙境地。这也是最近对于欣赏此类电影、小说甚至绘画的小小体会，即有意在看到的、听到的之外，挖掘那些未明的、有些神秘玄妙的内涵。我想，真正想要摆脱快速消费品命运的创作，是要注意这种言外之意、韵外之致的。</p>
<p>从IMDB上摘录些台词如下：</p>
<p>关于信仰、世界观：</p>
<p>Celine: I believe if there’s any kind of God it<br>wouldn’t be in any of us, not you or me but just this little space<br>in between. If there’s any kind of magic in this world it must be<br>in the attempt of understanding someone sharing something. I know,<br>it’s almost impossible to succeed but who cares really? The answer<br>must be in the attempt. &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Before sunrise (1995)</p>
<hr>
<p>关于转生的一个奇怪想法，Jesse对于此类神秘概念很着迷:-)</p>
<p>Jesse: I don’t know, I think that if I could just<br>accept the fact that my life is supposed to be difficult. You know,<br>that’s what to be expected, then I might not get so pissed-off<br>about it and I’ll just be glad when something nice happens.Jesse:<br>OK, well this was my thought: 50,000 years ago, there are not even<br>a million people on the planet. 10,000 years ago, there’s, like,<br>two million people on the planet. Now there’s between five and six<br>billion people on the planet, right? Now, if we all have our own,<br>like, individual, unique soul, right, where do they all come from?<br>You know, are modern souls only a fraction of the original souls?<br>‘Cause if they are, that represents a 5,000 to 1 split of each soul<br>in the last 50,000 years, which is, like, a blip in the Earth’s<br>time. You know, so at best we’re like these tiny fractions of<br>people, you know, walking… I mean, is that why we’re so<br>scattered? You know, is that why we’re all so specialized?</p>
<p>Celine: I don’t know. Wait a minute, I’m not sure…<br>I don’t…</p>
<p>Jesse: Yeah, hang on, hang on. It’s a, it’s a<br>totally scattered thought. It… which is kind of why it makes<br>sense. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Before sunrise (1995)</p>
<p>————————-&nbsp;</p>
<p>关于生死：</p>
<p>Celine: I used to think that if none of your family<br>or friends knew you were dead, it was like not really being dead.<br>People can invent the best and the worst for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Before sunrise (1995)</p>
<hr>
<p>Jesse: This friend of mine had a kid, and it was a<br>home birth, so he was there helping out and everything. And he said<br>at that profound moment of birth, he was watching this child,<br>experiencing life for the first time, I mean, trying to take its<br>first breath… all he could think about was that he was looking at<br>something that was gonna die someday. He just couldn’t get it out<br>of his head. And I think that’s so true, I mean, all - everything<br>is so finite. But don’t you think that that’s what, makes our time,<br>at specific moments, so important? &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before<br>sunrise (1995)</p>
<hr>
<p>关于自我：</p>
<p>Jesse: I know what you mean about wishing somebody<br>wasn’t there, though. It’s just usually it’s myself that I wish I<br>could get away from. Seriously, think about this. I have never been<br>anywhere that I haven’t been. I’ve never had a kiss when I wasn’t<br>one of the kissers. Y’know, I’ve never, um, gone to the movies,<br>when I wasn’t there in the audience. I’ve never been out bowling,<br>if I wasn’t there, y’know making some stupid joke. I think that’s<br>why so many people hate themselves. Seriously, it’s just they are<br>sick to death of being around themselves. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Jesse: Let’s say that you and I were together all<br>the time, then you’d start to hate a lot of my mannerisms. The way<br>every time we would have people over, uh, I’d be insecure, and I’d<br>get a little too drunk. Or, uh, the way I’d tell the same stupid<br>pseudo-intellectual story again, and again. Y’see, I’ve heard all<br>those stories. So of course I’m sick of myself. But being with you,<br>uh, it’s made me feel like I’m somebody else.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;Before sunrise (1995)</p>
<hr>
<p>Jesse: Sometimes I dream about being a good father<br>and a good husband. And sometimes it feels really close. But then<br>other times it seems silly like it would ruin my whole life. And<br>it’s not just a fear of commitment or that I’m incapable of caring<br>or loving because… I can. It’s just that, if I’m totally honest<br>with myself I think I’d rather die knowing that I was really good<br>at something. That I had excelled in some way than that I’d just<br>been in a nice, caring relationship.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;Before sunrise (1995)</p>
<hr>
<p>Jesse: Maybe what I’m saying is, is the world might<br>be evolving the way a person evolves. Right? Like, I mean, me for<br>example. Am I getting worse? Am I improving? I don’t know. When I<br>was younger, I was healthier, but I was, uh, whacked with<br>insecurity, you know? Now I’m older and my problems are deeper, but<br>I’m more equipped to handle them.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Before sunset(2004)</p>
<hr>
<p>关于亲密关系：</p>
<p>Celine: When you talked earlier about after a few<br>years how a couple would begin to hate each other by anticipating<br>their reactions or getting tired of their mannerisms-I think it<br>would be the opposite for me. I think I can really fall in love<br>when I know everything about someone-the way he’s going to part his<br>hair, which shirt he’s going to wear that day, knowing the exact<br>story he’d tell in a given situation. I’m sure that’s when I know<br>I’m really in love.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Before sunrise (1995)</p>
<hr>
<p>Jesse: Oh, God, why didn’t we exchange phone numbers<br>and stuff? Why didn’t we do that?Celine: Because we were young and<br>stupid.Jesse: Do you think we still are?</p>
<p>Celine: I guess when you’re young, you just believe<br>there’ll be many people with whom you’ll connect with. Later in<br>life, you realize it only happens a few times.</p>
<p>Jesse: And you can screw it up, you know,<br>misconnect.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Before sunset(2004)</p>
